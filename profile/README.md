## Hi there 👋

Amidst the tranquil woods and skies so blue,
The Disease Decision Analysis group retreats,
A gathering of scholars wise and true,
To delve into the mysteries of disease.

They ponder data, graphs, and models too,
To understand the patterns they perceive,
The better to predict what may ensue,
And intervene before the worst conceive.

Yet even in the midst of all their work,
There's time to rest, to chat, to share a meal,
And bask in nature's beauty, not to shirk
The pleasures that a group retreat can seal.

So here's to DDAR, to all they've done,
And all the battles they have yet to won. -ChatGPT
